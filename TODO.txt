******************************
Version 1.x
===========

* 6400 mils

* Bug: sometimes (when?) the compass seems not to react on ring rotation. After switching to background and back,
  it has been rotated after all.

* Calibration value, now only between 0...33%, any change or better ideas to work around?

* Vibra? Haptics feedback?

* Compass needle graphics: ambient highlight or always red?

* Color settings?

* Switch row: use highlight color when selected?

* Setting for compass default on/off when in background?

* Localization?

******************************
Version 2.0
===========

* Declination
