Orienteering compass application for the SailfishOS (Jolla).

Traditional compass for walking, hiking, orienteering etc. It is
like a regular hand-held compass and also allows you to change the
compass scale (360 degrees, 400 gradians or 6000 mils) and provides
an automatic or locked night mode (lights off when you are in the dark).

Orienteering compass was originally written for MeeGo/Nokia N9,
now re-written for SailfishOS.
